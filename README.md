# Sankey Diagram

**Author:** Dao Bui  
**Date Created:** 05/20/2025  

## üìå Description

This project creates an animated Sankey diagram from a data file, visually representing the distribution of values across categories using smooth, colored flows and proportional bars. It uses the `graphics.py` library to render the visualization in a GUI and saves the output as both PDF and PostScript files.
